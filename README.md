# IdleTale Compendium

This project firstly was created for creating/sharing players talents builds in the [IdleTale](https://store.steampowered.com/app/3196540/IdleTale/) game.
I currently have other tools planned, such as Glory Planner and Character Builder. 

## Current Features

Talents Tree Builder:
* Put points into any talent from both talents trees.
* Limiting of total talents points.
* Restriction to use talents without unlocking predecessor.
* Level-based restrictions.
* Counter of branches levels.
* Generate, save and use your tree build (BETA).
* Showing information about talents (tooltip).
* Turn on/off tooltips above talents.

Character Builder:
* None.

Glory Planner:
* None.

## Current TODOs

* ~~Limiting of total talents points.~~
* ~~Showing information about talents.~~
* ~~Saving tree via generated code.~~
* ~~Using generated code for sharing trees (generate-copy-paste)~~.
* Find other bugs xD
* Improve code quality
